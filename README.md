## 📖 The Story Behind This Project
In 2023, my partner suffered two strokes caused by an AVM, resulting in right-side hemiparesis and aphasia. During her initial recovery, she used professional robotic/virtual systems (like 'Amadeo') with incredible results. However, after a second, more severe stroke, we lost access to that technology and were left with only a traditional physical mirror box.

Realizing the gap between expensive medical tech and what patients have at home, I decided to use my skills as a developer to bridge it. I built this tool to replicate the immersive experience of professional therapy using just a smartphone and a standard VR headset.

I am sharing this **100% free** for personal use to help other survivors and families who cannot afford expensive equipment. The code is public so everyone can verify that it is safe and private.
